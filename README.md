# MicroBit-Sink-the-Ship
3 Micro:Bits needed.

The controller script has to go on 2 of the Micro:bits, and the other script has to go on the main unit. 

On the first controller change the PLAYER_NAME Variable to 1. 

and make sure player 1 places the ships first, then player 2. The main unit will display which Player has to place their ships at the current time.

When you hit a ship the main unit will display an "!" to show that you hit if you dont hit it will just go to the next players turn.


Controlls:
B button to go right
A button to go down
Hold B and press A to place/shoot

Have Fun i Guess
